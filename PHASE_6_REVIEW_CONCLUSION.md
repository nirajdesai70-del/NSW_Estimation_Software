## 🔍 Key Findings

### From Week 4 Evidence Review

**Locked Invariants (6 Rules):**
1. Copy-never-link
2. QCD/QCA separation (Cost summary reads QCA only)
3. No costing breakup in quotation view (summary-only)
4. Fabrication remains summary-only
5. Schema canon frozen (Phase-6)
6. All changes are additive + read-only

**Week 4 Deliverables:**
- Day-1: Quotation lifecycle visibility (read-only)
- Day-2: Cost integrity guardrails (drift detection)
- Day-3: Expanded summary read APIs (render helpers)
- Day-4: Consolidated checks + API surface guard

**Test Coverage:**
- 7 new tests created
- 3 regression tests passing
- All tests passing (0.16s - 0.46s execution time)

### From Master Consolidated Document Review

**Document Organization:**
- 9 major sections established
- 17+ documents organized
- Clear categorization by type and purpose
- Cross-references established

**Document Status:**
- ✅ Core planning documents: All found
- ✅ Week 4 evidence: Found and reviewed
- ⏳ Some documents: Filtered or need creation
- ❌ Week 1-3 evidence: Not found
