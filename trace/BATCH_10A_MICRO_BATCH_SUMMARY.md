|------|------------|------------|--------|
| General | +1 | 4 | ✅ Interconnections added |
| Structure | +1 | 3 | ✅ Numbering system added |
| Migration | +1 | 3 | ✅ V2 implementation plan added |

---

## Rationale

These 3 files were selected for the micro-batch because:
1. **PART4_NUMBERING.md** - Critical structure documentation (numbering system)
2. **PART10_INTERCONNECTIONS.md** - Important general documentation (data flow and relationships)
3. **PROJECT_V2_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md** - Important migration/change documentation (V2 plan)

All three are high-value additions that strengthen the Project baseline without excessive expansion.

## Verification

- ✅ All files copied (not moved from snapshot)
- ✅ All files stamped with source attribution
- ✅ Snapshot remains untouched
- ✅ Original `../nish` remains untouched

**Batch 10A Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE**  
**Files Added:** 3 (2 features + 1 change)  
**Total Project Files:** 16 (13 from Batch 09A + 3 from Batch 10A)  
**Ready for:** Project baseline freeze
