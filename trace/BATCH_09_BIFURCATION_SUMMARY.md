## Area Coverage After Batch 09

| Area | Files Copied | Status | Notes |
|------|--------------|--------|-------|
| General (Overview) | 3 | ✅ | Index + module overview + foundation |
| Lifecycle | 3 | ✅ | Data models + structure + operations |
| Quotation Linkage | 2 | ✅ | Architecture analysis + API usage |
| Status/Approvals | 2 | ✅ | Rules + change management standard |
| Milestones | 0 | ⚠️ | None found yet |
| Reports | 1 | ✅ | Costing dashboard brief |

---

## Key Findings

### ✅ Well-Covered Areas
- **General:** 3 files (index + module overview + foundation)
- **Lifecycle:** 3 files (data models + structure + operations)
- **Quotation Linkage:** 2 files (architecture analysis + API usage)
- **Status/Approvals:** 2 files (rules + change management standard)
- **Reports:** 1 file (costing dashboard brief)

### ⚠️ Areas with Limited Coverage
- **Milestones:** No dedicated milestones docs found

### 📋 Additional Files Found (Not Copied Yet)
- `PROJECT_BACKEND_DESIGN_PART4_NUMBERING.md` - Numbering system (may be lifecycle-related)
- `PROJECT_BACKEND_DESIGN_PART6_SERVICES.md` - Services (may be lifecycle-related)
- `PROJECT_BACKEND_DESIGN_PART7_MASTER_DATA.md` - Master data (may be lifecycle-related)
- `PROJECT_BACKEND_DESIGN_PART9_LOGIC.md` - Logic (may be lifecycle-related)
- `PROJECT_BACKEND_DESIGN_PART10_INTERCONNECTIONS.md` - Interconnections (may be general)
- `PROJECT_BACKEND_DESIGN_PART11_CODEBASE.md` - Codebase (may be trace-related)
- `PROJECT_V2_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` - V2 implementation plan (may be migration/change)
- `PROJECT_DATA_RESTORE_GUIDE.md` - Data restore guide (may be migration)
- `PROJECT_DATA_ANALYSIS.md` - Data analysis (may be migration)
- `C3D1_PROJECT_ANALYSIS_AND_GAPS.md` - Analysis and gaps (may be changes)

**Note:** These may be included in Batch 10 or additional batches based on priority and validation.

## Placement Decisions

### Features Folder (11 files)
- **Purpose:** Files that explain "what it is / how to use / architecture / rules"
- **Files:** Backend design series, module overview, architecture analysis, rules, standards, reports

### Changes Folder (2 files)
- **Purpose:** Files that document architecture fixes, migrations, and completion status
- **Files:** Architecture fix completion and summary

---

## Next Steps

1. **Review placements:** Validate all files are correctly categorized
2. **Consider additional files:** Review remaining Project Backend Design parts for Batch 10 if needed
3. **Milestones documentation:** Determine if dedicated milestones docs are needed or if lifecycle coverage is sufficient
4. **Stub READMEs:** Create stubs for milestones if no dedicated docs found

---

## Verification

- ✅ All files copied (not moved)
- ✅ All files stamped with source attribution
- ✅ Snapshot remains untouched
- ✅ Original `../nish` remains untouched

---

**Batch 09 Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE**  
**Files Copied:** 13 (11 features + 2 changes)  
**Ready for:** Validation and Batch 10 or baseline freeze
