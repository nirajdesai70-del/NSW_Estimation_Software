## 🔍 NISH Legacy System Review

### References Found

**From codebase search:**
- `project/nish/README.md` - NISH legacy system analysis track
- Legacy system references in Phase 2 documents
- NEPL to NSW migration references

### NISH Legacy System Context

**From `project/nish/README.md`:**
- **Status:** READ-ONLY Analysis Track (Separate from Phase 5)
- **Purpose:** Legacy data discovery, mapping, and migration planning
- **Governance:** Standalone project, independent of Phase 4 execution and Phase 5 scope
- **Scope:** Legacy data discovery and migration planning (Steps 3 & 4)

**Key Points:**
1. **Separate from Phase 5** - This is a standalone analysis track
2. **Read-only analysis** - No schema changes, no data writes, no code changes
3. **Legacy data work** - Extract and document legacy database schema
4. **Migration planning** - Create mapping matrix (Legacy → NSW)
5. **Migration execution** - Requires separate project approval, only after Phase 5 completes

### NISH Legacy System in Phase 6 Context

**Track A-R: Reuse & Legacy Parity**
- **Scope:** Legacy system feature parity
- **Deliverables:**
  - Reuse workflows
  - Legacy data import/export
  - Feature parity verification
  - Migration tools

**Connection to Phase 6:**
- Phase 6 Track A-R focuses on **reuse functionality** and **legacy parity**
- NISH legacy system review is **separate** but **related**
- Phase 6 needs to understand legacy system for parity requirements
- Migration tools may be needed for Phase 6 legacy data import

### NISH Legacy System Details

**From `project/nish/README.md`:**

**Purpose:**
1. Extract and document legacy database schema from `/Users/nirajdesai/Projects/nish/` (old legacy codebase + SQL data)
2. Assess legacy data quality
3. Create mapping matrix (Legacy → NSW)
4. Identify gaps and migration risks
5. Produce migration strategy and cutover plan

**Critical Rules:**
- **Analysis only** - No schema changes, no data writes, no code changes
- Output is documents + mapping tables + migration scripts draft (not executed)
- Can proceed in parallel as analysis-only
- Migration execution requires separate project approval
- Can only proceed after Phase 5 completes

**Folder Structure:**
```
project/nish/
├── README.md
├── 01_SEMANTICS/
│   └── DATA_SEMANTICS_LOCK.md
├── 02_LEGACY_SCHEMA/
│   ├── LEGACY_SCHEMA_EXTRACTION_PLAN.md
│   ├── LEGACY_SCHEMA_REPORT.md (to be generated)
│   └── exports/ (SQL dumps, Excel exports)
├── 03_NSW_SCHEMA/
│   ├── NSW_SCHEMA_CANON.md (to be generated)
│   ├── NSW_SCHEMA_DICTIONARY.md (to be generated)
│   └── exports/ (migration analysis, Excel exports)
```

**Scope Separation:**
- **Phase 5 Scope:** Only canonical data dictionary and schema design (Steps 1 & 2)
- **NISH Project Scope:** Legacy data discovery and migration planning (Steps 3 & 4)
- **See:** `docs/PHASE_5/SCOPE_SEPARATION.md` for detailed explanation

### NISH Legacy System Review Tasks for Phase 6

**From Phase 6 Scope:**
- [ ] Review NISH legacy system documentation (`project/nish/README.md`)
- [ ] Understand legacy data structure (from `02_LEGACY_SCHEMA/`)
- [ ] Review legacy schema extraction plan
- [ ] Map legacy features to Phase 6 tracks (especially Track A-R)
- [ ] Identify parity requirements for Track A-R
- [ ] Plan migration tools for Phase 6 (if needed)
- [ ] Review mapping matrix (Legacy → NSW) when available
- [ ] Understand migration risks for Phase 6 planning
