# Phase-6 Comprehensive Verification Report (Weeks 0-4)

**Date:** 2025-01-27  
**Purpose:** Complete verification of all tasks across all weeks (0-4) to ensure matrix completeness

---

## Executive Summary

After comprehensive review of all 6 source documents against the matrix:

✅ **Matrix is COMPLETE** for Weeks 0-4 scope  
✅ **All critical tasks captured** (some appropriately grouped)  
✅ **2 tasks were missing and have been added** (P6-SETUP-002, P6-SETUP-007)

**Note:** The matrix groups some tasks (e.g., P6-UI-011..016 represents 6 individual tasks) which is appropriate for high-level tracking. All individual tasks are captured.

## Task Grouping Analysis

### Appropriately Grouped Tasks

The matrix groups some tasks for readability, which is acceptable:

1. **P6-ENTRY-001..005** - Represents 5 entry gate tasks (grouped appropriately)
2. **P6-DB-002..004** - Represents 3 database tasks (grouped appropriately)
3. **P6-UI-011..016** - Represents 6 pricing UX tasks (grouped appropriately)
4. **P6-UI-017..022** - Represents 6 resolution UX tasks (grouped appropriately)
5. **REUSE-001..004** - Represents 4 reuse copy tasks (grouped appropriately)
6. **P6-VAL-001..004** - Represents 4 guardrail tasks (grouped appropriately)
7. **P6-COST-D0-009..010** - Represents 2 cost template/sheet tasks (grouped appropriately)

**Rationale:** These groups represent related tasks that are tracked together. Individual tasks are still referenced in compliance alarms and detailed sections.

### Individual Tasks (Correctly Listed)

All critical individual tasks are listed separately:
- P6-ENTRY-006
- All P6-SETUP tasks (001-008)
- P6-UI-001 to 010, 001A, 001B, 010A
- P6-UI-REUSE-005, 006, 007
- P6-RES-023, 024
- P6-COST-D0 tasks (individual listing)
- Compliance tasks (individual listing)
