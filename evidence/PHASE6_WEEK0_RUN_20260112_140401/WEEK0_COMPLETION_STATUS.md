**What This Means:**
- ✅ Week-0 compliance blockers are cleared
- ✅ Governance foundation is established
- ✅ Task register is active
- ✅ QCD contract is frozen
- ✅ D0 Gate checklist is defined
- ✅ Naming compliance is verified

**You can proceed to:**
- Week-1 planning and execution

### ⚠️ PARTIAL — For Complete Week-0 Closure

**Status:** 9 remaining Week-0 tasks (not compliance-blocking).

**What's Missing:**
- 4 Entry gate verification records (P6-ENTRY-002..005)
- 4 Setup review documents (P6-SETUP-002, 004, 007, 008)
- 1 DB decision document (P6-DB-001)

**These are:**
- 🟡 Medium priority (entry gate docs)
- 🟠 High priority (setup docs)
- Not compliance-blocking
- Can be completed in parallel with Week-1 work

---

## Recommendation

### Option A: Proceed to Week-1 (Recommended)

**Rationale:**
- ✅ All compliance alarms resolved
- ✅ Governance foundation complete
- ✅ No blocking dependencies
- ⚠️ Remaining Week-0 tasks are documentation-only (can be done in parallel)

**Action:**
1. Move 5 compliance docs to final locations (when accessible)
2. Start Week-1 work
3. Complete remaining Week-0 docs in parallel (non-blocking)

---

### Option B: Complete All Week-0 Tasks First

**Rationale:**
- Complete Week-0 closure before moving forward
- Clean handoff to Week-1

**Action:**
1. Create remaining 9 Week-0 documents
2. Update Week-0 closure record
3. Get explicit Week-0 signoff
4. Then proceed to Week-1

---

## Decision Matrix

| Scenario | Compliance Docs | Remaining Docs | Can Proceed? |
|----------|-----------------|----------------|--------------|
| **Current State** | ✅ 5/5 DONE | ❌ 9/9 MISSING | ✅ **YES** (compliance cleared) |
| **Full Closure** | ✅ 5/5 DONE | ✅ 9/9 DONE | ✅ **YES** (complete) |

---

## Final Answer

**Week-0 Status:** ⚠️ **PARTIALLY COMPLETE**

- ✅ **Compliance-critical work:** COMPLETE (all 5 compliance alarms resolved)
- ⚠️ **Full Week-0 closure:** PENDING (9 non-compliance tasks remaining)

**Can We Go Further?**

✅ **YES** — You can proceed to Week-1 because:
1. All compliance blockers are cleared
2. Governance foundation is established
3. Remaining tasks are non-blocking documentation

**Recommended Path:**
- Proceed to Week-1 execution
- Complete remaining Week-0 docs in parallel (they're lightweight verification records)
- Update Week-0 closure record as docs are completed
