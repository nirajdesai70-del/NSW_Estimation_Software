# Housekeeping Archive

Created: 20260103_164434

This archive contains:
- Output debris (tmp/test/debug files)
- Selected historical markdown execution docs
- Full backup snapshot of scripts/ before any moves
- One-off scripts (if Phase 2 was run)

**No files were deleted.**

## Structure

- `tmp_outputs/` - Temporary intermediate files
- `test_outputs/` - Test execution outputs
- `old_outputs/` - Superseded final outputs
- `debug/` - Debug files and logs
- `docs/` - Historical execution documentation
- `backup/` - Full backup of scripts/ folder
- `one_off_scripts/` - Temporary fix scripts (if Phase 2 run)

## Next Steps

- **Phase 1 only**: Safe cleanup complete. Scripts untouched.
- **Phase 2 run**: Scripts organized. Stub files created for moved scripts.

**Rule:** New execution debris should go to `SoW/` (temporary) or `ARCH/` (after freeze), not here.
