# NSW Terminology & Levels Freeze v1

**Status:** FINAL FOR PROJECT USE (v1.2)  
**Date:** 2025-01-XX  
**Scope:** Naming only (no semantic change), to eliminate confusion across business classification vs engineering configuration vs SKU pricing.

---

## 0) Engineering Bank Operating Reality

**Purpose:** This section defines the authoritative operating reality for Engineering Bank canonical meanings. It overrides ambiguous interpretations and provides the ground truth for all catalog work.

### 0.1 Structural vs Capability vs Attribute Separation (MANDATORY)

**Three distinct concepts must never be confused:**

1. **Structural Construction Layers (SC_Lx / SCL)**
   - Physical construction elements: Frame, Poles, Actuation, Mounting, Terminals, Zones, Enclosure, Variants
   - Describes "how it's built" not "what it does"
   - SC_Lx MUST NOT be used for options, features, or capabilities
   - Example: `SC_L1 = FRAME-1` (structural), NOT `SC_L1 = AC_COIL` (capability)

2. **Capability**
   - Engineering options/features: inclusion/exclusion flag set (multi-select)
   - Uses `capability_codes` column (primary)
   - Optional `capability_class_1..4` for grouping axes (if needed)
   - Example: `capability_codes = AUX_CONTACT_BLOCK, MECHANICAL_INTERLOCK`

3. **Attributes (ATTR_*)**
   - Additional specification parameters
   - Populated only if explicitly defined in OEM catalog
   - Example: `ATTR_VOLTAGE = 230V`, `ATTR_CURRENT = 16A`

**Hard Rule:** SC_Lx and capability are separate concepts. Never auto-map SC_Lx to capability_class_x.

### 0.1B Two-Worlds Warning (Mandatory)

Business classification and Engineering selection are different axes:
- Business Category/Segment = classification only (navigation/reporting)
- SCL/Capability/Attributes = engineering selection/spec

Forbidden:
- Inferring capability from business classification
- Using business terms as engineering terms

### 0.2 Generic Naming Neutrality Rule

**MANDATORY:** Generic names and descriptions must be vendor- and series-neutral.

- Do NOT include: OEM name (Schneider, ABB, Siemens, etc.)
- Do NOT include: Series (LC1E, GZ1E, NSX, NW, etc.)
- Do NOT include: Family names
- Make/Series are allowed ONLY at L2 (SKU level)

**Examples:**
- ✅ Correct: "Contactor, 3-Pole, AC Coil"
- ❌ Wrong: "Schneider LC1E Contactor"
- ❌ Wrong: "LC1E 3-Pole Contactor"

### 0.3 Layer Discipline (Hard Boundary)

- Layer-1 (Catalog → Item Master): record facts only; no inference/validation/dependency logic.
- Layer-2 (Engineering/BOM): apply rules, capability logic, dependencies, QC.

Reminder:
- L0/L1/L2 are engineering levels (intent/spec/SKU).
- Make/Series/Price are L2-only.

### 0.4 Sheet Semantics

Engineering Bank sheets have canonical meanings:
- `SC_DEFINITION` defines what SC_Lx represents (structural only)
- `TERMINOLOGY_ALIASES` maps terms (SC_Lx → SCL, not capability)
- `DECISION_REGISTER` records locked decisions

### 0.5 AI Safety Boundary (Mandatory)

Excel protection applies only inside Excel.
AI tools ignore hidden/locked sheets.

- Never upload MASTER files to AI tools.
- Only upload AI-SAFE WORK files containing DATA_* sheets.

---


### SC_Lx Final Statement (Authoritative)

- SC_L1..SC_L8 represent **SCL (Structural Construction Layers)** only.
- SC_Lx describes physical construction (frame, poles, actuation, mounting, terminals, zones, enclosure, variants).
- SC_Lx MUST NOT be used for capability/options/features.
- Capability is represented separately using `capability_codes` (and optional capability_class_1..4 if needed).
- Never auto-map SC_Lx to capability_class_x.


## 1) Why this file exists

We discovered repeated confusion because the same words ("Category", "SubCategory") were being used in two different worlds:
1. **Business/Catalog classification**
2. **Engineering configuration/capability selection**

This file introduces non-conflicting terminology while preserving NSW Doctrine v2.0 meaning.

**Reference:** `NSW Fundamental Alignment Plan/01_FUNDAMENTALS/MASTER_FUNDAMENTALS_v2.0.md`

## 2) The three worlds (frozen)

### World A — Business/Catalog Classification

**Used for:** navigation, reporting, catalog grouping

| Old term | New term | Meaning |
|----------|----------|---------|
| Category | **Business Category** | Business grouping bucket (e.g., Motor Control, Protection Devices) |
| SubCategory (business) | **Business Segment** | Sub-group inside Business Category (e.g., Contactor, MCCB, ACB) |

**Rule:** Business Category/Segment is classification only; it does not define specs or pricing.

**Current Code Usage:** ✅ `business_subcategory` already used in codebase (aligned!)

---

### World B — Engineering Object Model (NSW levels)

**Used for:** specification + resolution path

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **Item/ProductType** | Engineering identity of the device (e.g., Contactor, MCCB, ACB, VFD) |
| **L0** | Generic intent template (no numeric ratings) |
| **L1** | Generic spec (numeric ratings/specs; still non-OEM) |
| **L2** | OEM specific SKU (Make + Series/Model + MPN/SKU + PriceListRef + Price) |

**Hard rule:** Make/Series/SKU/Price are L2-only.

**Current Code Usage:** ✅ `item_producttype`, L0/L1/L2 concepts well-established

---

### World C — Engineering Capability Selection

**Used for:** included/excluded options, features, add-ons (not business segment)

| Old term | New term | Meaning |
|----------|----------|---------|
| SubCategory (engineering capability) | **Capability** | Additive option/capability selection (WITH_OLR, AUX_CONTACT, SHUNT, DRAWOUT, etc.) |
SC_L1..SC_L8 | SCL (Structural Construction Layers) | Physical construction elements (Frame, Poles, Actuation, Mounting, Terminals, Zones, Enclosure, Variants)
| Feature line | **Feature Line** | Separate L1 line representing feature intent that may affect SKU resolution |

**Rule:** Capability is not numeric, not priced, can be multiple. Numeric values belong to Attributes (KVU) at L1.

**Current Code Usage:** ⚠️ `SC_L1`, `SC_L2`, `SC_L3`, `SC_L4` used extensively (193 matches) - **Phased rename recommended**

**Migration Note:** During transition, code supports both `SC_Lx` and `capability_class_x` for backward compatibility.

---

## 3)

### Universal Population Rule (Applies to ALL SC_Lx and ATTR_*)

**MANDATORY:** Populate SC_Lx or ATTR_* fields ONLY if explicitly defined in the OEM catalog.

- Do NOT substitute series, family, or marketing names
- Do NOT guess or infer values
- Leave blank if not explicitly stated in source catalog
- Applies across all product types

Examples:
- ✅ Correct: If catalog says "Frame: FRAME-1", populate `SC_L1 = FRAME-1`
- ❌ Wrong: If catalog doesn't mention frame, do NOT populate `SC_L1` with a series name

 Level definitions (frozen)

### L0 (Generic intent)

**Contains:**
- Business Category, Business Segment
- Item/ProductType
- Capability selections (as labels only)
- Generic descriptor

**Does NOT contain:**
- numeric ratings (A/kA/kW/V/Poles)
- make/series/SKU/price

### L1 (Generic spec)

**Adds:**
- numeric ratings/specs via KVU attributes

**Still does NOT contain:**
- make/series/SKU/price

### L2 (Specific OEM)

**Adds:**
- make
- series/model
- OEM catalog number / SKU
- price list reference + price

**Reference:** `NSW Fundamental Alignment Plan/02_GOVERNANCE/NEPL_CANONICAL_RULES.md` (Section 1.1)

---

## 4) Naming conventions (recommended, project-wide)

### Recommended column names

Use these names to avoid collisions:

**Business:**
- `business_category`
- `business_segment`

**Engineering:**
- `item_producttype`
- `l0_code`, `l0_name`
- `l1_code`, `l1_name`

**Capability selection:**
- `capability_codes` (semicolon list or junction table later)
- `capability_class_1` … `capability_class_4` (preferred)
- `SC_L1` … `SC_L4` (legacy, supported during transition)

**Specific:**
- `make`
- `oem_series` or `series_bucket`
- `sku_code` or `oem_catalog_no`
- `price_list_ref`
- `effective_from`, `rate_inr`

**Current Code Alignment:**
- ✅ `business_subcategory` - Already aligned
- ✅ `item_producttype` - Already aligned
SC_L1..SC_L8 | SCL (Structural Construction Layers) | Physical construction elements (Frame, Poles, Actuation, Mounting, Terminals, Zones, Enclosure, Variants)

---

## 5) Project update instruction (for Cursor)

### What must be updated

1. **Replace generic use of "SubCategory" into:**
   - `business_segment` when referring to classification
   - `capability` when referring to options/features

2. **Ensure all documentation, sheets, and schemas keep:**
   - Business Category/Segment separate from capability selection

3. **Enforce L0/L1/L2 separation:**
   - L0 no ratings
   - L1 ratings (KVU)
   - L2 SKU + price only

4. **Phased SC_Lx rename:**
   - New code: Use `capability_class_1-4`
   - Legacy code: Support both `SC_Lx` and `capability_class_x` during transition
   - Documentation: Use `capability_class_x` terminology

### What must NOT be changed

- ❌ No semantic re-interpretation of NSW Doctrine v2.0
- ❌ Only terminology + column label alignment
- ❌ No breaking changes to active code (phased approach)

## 7) Migration path

### Phase 1: Freeze (Immediate)
- ✅ Create this freeze document
- ✅ Update documentation to reference freeze
- ✅ New code uses freeze terminology

### Phase 2: Transition (Short-term)
- ⚠️ Support both `SC_Lx` and `capability_class_x` in code
- ⚠️ Update documentation to use new terminology
- ⚠️ Add `business_` prefix where Category is used

### Phase 3: Full Migration (Medium-term)
- ⚠️ Rename `SC_Lx` → `capability_class_x` in all code
- ⚠️ Remove backward compatibility after full migration
- ⚠️ Update all sheet references

---

## 8) Freeze statement

This terminology is **mandatory** across:
- Documentation
- Excel sheets
- DB schema
- Import pipelines
- UI labels

It is intended to eliminate naming ambiguity while preserving NSW Doctrine v2.0 semantics.

**No semantic changes** - only terminology + column label alignment.

### Capability vs Feature Line (Separation)

- Capability = inclusion/exclusion flags (multi-select)
- Feature Line = separate L1 line ONLY when it affects L2 explosion or vendor variability

### Name Collision Note

Business Segment and Item/ProductType may share the same label (e.g., "Contactor").
They are still different concepts. Never infer mapping based on matching names.
