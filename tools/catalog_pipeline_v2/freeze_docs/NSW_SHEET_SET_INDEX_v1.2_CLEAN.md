# NSW Sheet Set Index v1.2 (CLEAN)

**Status:** FINAL – AUTHORITATIVE (v1.2)  
**Scope:** SKU + Price Creation Pack (catalog ingestion layer)  
**Aligned With:** NSW Doctrine v2.0 + Terminology Freeze v1.2  
**Last Reviewed:** 2026-01-03

## 1) Purpose of this Index

Defines:
- ACTIVE sheets (authoritative)
- REFERENCE / LEGACY sheets (read-only)
- ARCHIVE-ready items
- What must never be edited or reused for new work

---

## 2) Terminology reminder (applies everywhere)

- business_category / business_segment → classification only  
- L0/L1/L2 → engineering levels (intent/spec/SKU)  
- capability_codes → options/features (not structural)  
- SC_Lx → SCL (structural construction layers only)  

(Ref: `NSW_TERMINOLOGY_AND_LEVELS_FREEZE_v1.2_CLEAN.md`)

---

## 2.1 Alias support during transition

- business_subcategory is a legacy alias for business_segment  
- SC_Lx are structural (SCL), not capability_class  
- Do not auto-map SC_Lx → capability_class_x  

---

## 3) Engineering Bank mapping table (authoritative)

| Cursor/Pipeline Sheet | Engineering Bank Sheet | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| NSW_SKU_MASTER_CANONICAL | DATA_SKU_PRICE_LIST | L2 SKU identity |
| NSW_ACCESSORY_SKU_MASTER | DATA_ACCESSORY_PRICE_LIST | Accessory SKU list |
| NSW_CATALOG_CHAIN_MASTER | DATA_ITEM_MASTER | Layer-1 minimal intent |
| NSW_PRICE_MATRIX_CANONICAL | PRICE_MATRIX | Commercial layer |

Note: Engineering Bank naming is authoritative for AI-assisted catalog work.

---

## 4) ACTIVE – Authoritative sheets (do not duplicate)

### 4.1 SKU & price core
| Sheet / File | Status | Purpose | Current name in code |
|---|---|---|---|
| NSW_SKU_MASTER_CANONICAL | ACTIVE | L2 SKU identity | NSW_L2_PRODUCTS (legacy alias) |
| NSW_PRICE_MATRIX_CANONICAL | ACTIVE | Price truth (SKU-only) | NSW_PRICE_MATRIX |
| NSW_PRICE_MATRIX_QC | PLANNED | Price coverage report | (create if missing) |

Rules:
- Price must never be stored outside Price Matrix
- SKU is the atomic priced object

### 4.2 Catalog chain (minimal continuity)
| Sheet | Status | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| NSW_CATALOG_CHAIN_MASTER | ACTIVE | L0/L1/L2 continuity chain |

Rules:
- No OEM series at L0/L1
- No price in chain sheet

### Decision CLOSED (Catalog Chain)
- NSW_CATALOG_CHAIN_MASTER is canonical for continuity  
- NSW_L1_CONFIG_LINES is legacy parse output (archive after QC verification)  

---

## 5) REFERENCE / LEGACY (read-only)

| Sheet | Status | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| NSW_L1_CONFIG_LINES | LEGACY | parse artifact (duty×voltage expansion); do not edit |
| NSW_L2_PRODUCTS | LEGACY | compat export/alias only; do not edit |
| LC1E_* helper sheets | LEGACY | one-time extraction helpers |

---

## 6) ARCHIVE-READY (after final check)

Archive only after:
- SKU master validated
- Price QC stable
- Catalog chain verified

Location:
- tools/catalog_pipeline_v2/archives/…

---

## 7) What this workbook is NOT

This pack is NOT:
- estimation runtime engine
- BOM explosion logic
- quotation rules

Those belong to Phase-5 estimation artifacts.

---

## 8) Safe workflow going forward

1) Add SKUs → NSW_SKU_MASTER_CANONICAL  
2) Add prices → NSW_PRICE_MATRIX_CANONICAL  
3) Link continuity → NSW_CATALOG_CHAIN_MASTER  
4) Keep legacy sheets read-only / archive-ready
