# NSW Terminology & Levels Freeze v1.2

**Status:** FINAL FOR PROJECT USE (v1.2)  
**Date:** 2026-01-03  
**Scope:** Naming + governance clarity (no semantic re-interpretation of NSW Doctrine v2.0)

---

## 0) Engineering Bank Operating Reality (Authoritative)

**Purpose:** This section defines the authoritative operating reality for Engineering Bank canonical meanings. It overrides ambiguous interpretations and provides ground truth for catalog work and AI-assisted workflows.

### 0.1 Structural vs Capability vs Attribute Separation (MANDATORY)

**Three distinct concepts must never be confused:**

1) **Structural Construction Layers (SC_Lx / SCL)**
- Physical construction elements: Frame, Poles, Actuation, Mounting, Terminals, Zones, Enclosure, Variants  
- SC_Lx describes "how it is built", not "what options it has"  
- SC_Lx MUST NOT be used for options/features/capabilities  
- Example: `SC_L1 = FRAME-1` (structural), NOT `SC_L1 = AUX_CONTACT` (capability)

2) **Capability**
- Engineering options/features: inclusion/exclusion flag set (multi-select)  
- Uses `capability_codes` (primary)  
- Optional `capability_class_1..4` only if you explicitly implement separate capability grouping axes  
- Example: `capability_codes = AUX_CONTACT_BLOCK;MECHANICAL_INTERLOCK`

3) **Attributes (ATTR_*)**
- KVU facts (numeric/spec values)  
- In Layer-1 price list entry: treat ATTR_* values as SKU facts only  
- Populate only if explicitly defined in the OEM catalog  
- Example: `ATTR_VOLTAGE = 230V`, `ATTR_CURRENT = 16A`

**Hard Rule:** SC_Lx and capability are separate concepts. Never auto-map SC_Lx to capability_class_x.

### 0.1B Two-Worlds Warning (Mandatory)

Business classification and engineering selection are different axes:
- Business Category/Segment = classification only (navigation/reporting)  
- SCL/Capability/Attributes = engineering selection/spec  

Forbidden:
- Inferring capability from business classification  
- Using business terms as engineering terms  

### 0.2 Generic Naming Neutrality Rule (MANDATORY)

Generic names and descriptions must be vendor- and series-neutral.

- Do NOT include: OEM name (Schneider, ABB, Siemens, etc.)  
- Do NOT include: Series/Family (LC1E, GZ1E, NSX, NW, etc.)  
- Make/Series are allowed only in identity fields and at **L2 (SKU level)**

Examples:
- ✅ "Contactor, 3-Pole, AC Coil"  
- ❌ "Schneider LC1E Contactor"  
- ❌ "LC1E 3-Pole Contactor"

### 0.3 Layer Discipline (Hard Boundary)

- Layer-1 (Catalog → Item Master): record facts only; no inference/validation/dependency logic.  
- Layer-2 (Engineering/BOM): apply rules, capability logic, dependencies, QC.  

Reminder:
- L0/L1/L2 are engineering levels (intent/spec/SKU)  
- Make/Series/Price are L2-only

### 0.4 Sheet Semantics (Engineering Bank)

- `SC_DEFINITION` defines what SC_Lx represents (structural only)  
- `TERMINOLOGY_ALIASES` maps terms (SC_Lx → SCL, not capability)  
- `DECISION_REGISTER` records locked decisions  

### 0.5 AI Safety Boundary (Mandatory)

Excel protection applies only inside Excel. AI tools ignore hidden/locked sheets.

- Never upload MASTER files to AI tools  
- Only upload AI-SAFE WORK files containing DATA_* sheets  

### 0.6 Universal Population Rule (Applies to ALL SC_Lx and ATTR_*)

Populate SC_Lx or ATTR_* fields ONLY if explicitly defined in the OEM catalog.

- Do NOT substitute series/family/marketing names  
- Do NOT guess or infer  
- Leave blank if not explicitly stated

## 1) Why this file exists

We discovered repeated confusion because the same words ("Category", "SubCategory") were used in multiple worlds:
1) Business/Catalog classification  
2) Engineering selection (capability/options)  

This file introduces non-conflicting terminology while preserving NSW Doctrine v2.0 meaning.

Reference: `NSW Fundamental Alignment Plan/01_FUNDAMENTALS/MASTER_FUNDAMENTALS_v2.0.md`

---

## 2) The three worlds (frozen)

### World A — Business/Catalog Classification
Used for: navigation, reporting, catalog grouping

| Old term | New term | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| Category | business_category | Business grouping bucket |
| SubCategory (business) | business_segment | Sub-group inside business_category |

Rule: Business Category/Segment is classification only; it does not define specs or pricing.

Current Code Usage:
- ✅ `business_subcategory` exists in codebase and is treated as a legacy alias for `business_segment` during transition.

---

### World B — Engineering Object Model (NSW levels)
Used for: specification + resolution path

| Term | Meaning |
|---|---|
| item_producttype | Engineering identity (e.g., Contactor, MCCB, ACB, VFD) |
| L0 | Generic intent template (no numeric ratings) |
| L1 | Generic spec (numeric ratings/specs; still non-OEM) |
| L2 | OEM specific SKU (make + series/model + SKU + price list ref + price) |

Hard rule: Make/Series/SKU/Price are L2-only.

---

### World C — Engineering Capability Selection
Used for: included/excluded options, features, add-ons (not business segmentation)

| Old term | New term | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| SubCategory (engineering capability) | capability_codes | Additive option selection (WITH_OLR, AUX_CONTACT, SHUNT, DRAWOUT, etc.) |
| SC_L1..SC_L8 | SCL (Structural Construction Layers) | Physical construction (frame/poles/actuation/mounting/terminals/zones/enclosure/variants) |
| Feature line | Feature Line | Separate L1 line representing feature intent that may affect SKU resolution |

Rule: Capability is not numeric and not priced in Layer-1. Numeric values belong to Attributes (KVU).

Migration Note:
- Legacy storage may still contain `SC_L1..SC_L4` in older pipelines.  
- Do NOT interpret SC_Lx as capability. Capability uses `capability_codes` (and optional capability_class_* only if explicitly implemented separately).

---

## 3) Level definitions (frozen)

### L0 (Generic intent)
Contains:
- business_category, business_segment
- item_producttype
- capability_codes labels (if needed)
- generic descriptor

Does NOT contain:
- numeric ratings (A/kA/kW/V/Poles)
- make/series/SKU/price

### L1 (Generic spec)
Adds:
- numeric ratings/specs via KVU attributes

Still does NOT contain:
- make/series/SKU/price

### L2 (Specific OEM)
Adds:
- make
- OEM series/model
- OEM catalog number / SKU
- price list reference + price

---

## 4) Naming conventions (recommended, project-wide)

Business:
- business_category
- business_segment

Engineering:
- item_producttype
- l0_code, l0_name
- l1_code, l1_name

Capability:
- capability_codes (semicolon list; later can become junction table)
- capability_class_1..4 (optional; only if implemented separately)
- SC_L1..SC_L8 remain SCL (structural), not capability

Specific (L2):
- make
- oem_series / series_bucket
- sku_code / oem_catalog_no
- price_list_ref
- effective_from, rate_inr

---

## 5) Project update instruction (for Cursor)

What must be updated:
1) Replace ambiguous "SubCategory" usage:
   - business_segment when referring to classification
   - capability_codes when referring to options/features

2) Enforce L0/L1/L2 separation:
   - L0 no ratings
   - L1 ratings (KVU)
   - L2 SKU + make/series + price only

3) SC_Lx semantics:
   - SC_Lx = SCL (structural only)
   - capability_codes holds features/options

What must NOT be changed:
- No semantic reinterpretation of NSW doctrine; only naming clarity + collision prevention.

---

## 6) Quick examples (for clarity)

### Contactor (correct example)
- business_category: Motor Control
- business_segment: Contactor
- item_producttype: Contactor
- L0: Power Contactor
- L1: Power Contactor – 3P | 2.2kW/3HP @415V (generic)
- L2: Schneider LC1* SKU + price (make/series/coil voltage live here)
- capability_codes: WITH_OLR; AUX_CONTACT

Note:
- Coil voltage is L2-only (SKU differentiator)
- AC1/AC3 are ratings (SKU_RATINGS), not capability

### MCCB (correct example)
- business_category: Protection Devices
- business_segment: MCCB
- item_producttype: MCCB
- L0: MCCB
- L1: MCCB – 100A | 3P | 25kA (generic)
- L2: OEM SKU + price
- capability_codes: SHUNT; UV; AUX_CONTACT
- SC_Lx: only construction (frame, mounting, terminals, etc.)

---

## 7) Migration path

Phase 1: Freeze (Immediate)
- v1.2 becomes authoritative naming + governance reference

Phase 2: Transition (Short-term)
- Support business_subcategory as alias → business_segment
- Preserve SC_Lx as SCL
- Introduce capability_codes where missing

Phase 3: Full migration (Medium-term)
- Optional: capability_class_* only if explicitly required (do not replace SC_Lx)

---

## 8) Freeze statement

This terminology is mandatory across:
- Documentation
- Excel sheets
- DB schema
- Import pipelines
- UI labels

No semantic change—only naming and collision prevention.
