# legacy/ (Reference Only)

## What this is
`legacy/` contains non-canonical historical material kept to avoid loss.

## Rules
- **Not authoritative.** No operational docs should depend on legacy content.
- If something in legacy is required for active work, it must be **adopted** via:
  - `docs/MIGRATION/ADOPTED_FROM_V1/` (docs)
  - `tools/MIGRATION/ADOPTED_FROM_V1/` (scripts)
- When promoted to canonical Zone A, leave behind a redirect stub and add an entry in:
  - `docs/GOVERNANCE/PATH_MOVE_REGISTER.md`
