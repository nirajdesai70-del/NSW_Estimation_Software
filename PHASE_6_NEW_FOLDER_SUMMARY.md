## Quick Summary for Review and Decision

**Date:** 2025-01-27  
**Status:** 📋 PLAN READY FOR REVIEW  
**Purpose:** Quick summary of new folder plan for review and approval

## 🎯 What We're Doing

Creating a **fresh, clean folder** called `NSW Estimation Software V1.0` that:
- Contains all Phase 6 documentation (138+ files)
- Has organized folder structure
- Serves as reference baseline
- Remains clean (docs only initially)
- Allows gradual code migration later

## 🔒 Key Rules

1. **Documentation-Only Initially** - Only docs, no code yet
2. **Folder Structure Locked** - Once created, changes need approval
3. **Master Document Authority** - `01_MASTER_DOCUMENTS/PHASE_6_FINAL_MASTER_CONSOLIDATED_PLAN.md` is primary
4. **Code Migration Later** - Copy code files only when needed for implementation
5. **Evidence Preserved** - All evidence in `10_EVIDENCE/`

---

## 📋 Transfer Approach

### Option 1: Manual Transfer (Recommended)
- Create folder structure
- Copy files phase by phase
- Verify each phase
- **Pros:** Controlled, verifiable
- **Cons:** Time-consuming

### Option 2: Automated Script
- Create structure + copy files
- Generate transfer log
- **Pros:** Fast, repeatable
- **Cons:** Requires verification

**Recommendation:** Start with Option 1 (manual), verify, then consider automation for remaining phases.
