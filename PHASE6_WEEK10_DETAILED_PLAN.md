# Phase-6 Week-10 Detailed Plan

**Week:** Week-10 (Excel Export + Stabilization)  
**Status:** ❌ NOT STARTED (Planning only)  
**Closure Status:** ⏳ Pending completion  
**Date Created:** 2025-01-27  
**Last Updated:** 2025-01-27

---

## Executive Summary

Week-10 externalizes approved, read-only outputs of NSW into Excel and shareable artifacts. This is the first controlled export layer for finance, management, and clients. No logic, pricing, or costing rules are introduced. Outputs must strictly reflect already-validated internal state. This includes Excel export implementation (quotation, costing pack, dashboard), export governance (permissions, watermarking, audit logging), and stabilization work.

**Key Deliverables (Week-10 Core Closure):**
- Excel Export (Track D - quotation, costing pack, dashboard Excel exports)
- Export Governance (Track C - permissions, watermarking, audit logging)
- Stabilization (stabilization work as needed)

**Critical Alarms (From Matrix):**
- 🔴 **Compliance Alarms** (must resolve for Week-10 closure)
  - Excel export implementation (P6-COST-014, 015, 017)
  - Export permissions (P6-OPS-013, 014)
  - Export audit logging (P6-OPS-016)
- 🟠 **High Priority Items** (design documentation, dashboard export, formatting, watermarking)

**Note:** Week-10 does NOT change meaning. Theme: "Expose, don't compute." All exports are read-only, snapshot-based, QCD/QCA only. Week-10 CANNOT START unless Week-8.5 Gate = PASS and Week-9 = CLOSED.

### 🔴 Compliance Alarms (Must Resolve Before Phase-6 Closure)

These alarms are **mandatory** for Phase-6 sign-off. They block governance compliance and cannot be deferred.

| Alarm ID | First Identified | Task ID(s) | Description | Status | Resolution Required |
|----------|------------------|------------|-------------|--------|---------------------|
| **ALARM-EXPORT-CORE** | Review 1 (Finalized Review 4) | P6-COST-014, P6-COST-015, P6-COST-017 | Excel exports missing or non-compliant (Excel export design, costing pack export, costing calculation UI integration) | ❌ MISSING | Implement Excel export design, costing pack export (engine-first, QCD/QCA only), and costing calculation UI integration - read-only, snapshot-only, QCD/QCA only |
| **ALARM-EXPORT-PERMISSIONS** | Review 1 (Finalized Review 4) | P6-OPS-013, P6-OPS-014 | Export permission leaks (operational risk) | ❌ MISSING | Implement export permission matrix and enforcement (role-based export access control, hard deny by default) |
| **ALARM-EXPORT-AUDIT** | Review 1 (Finalized Review 4) | P6-OPS-016 | Export not auditable (compliance risk) | ❌ MISSING | Implement export audit logging (who/when/what exported - audit events for all exports) |

---

## Week-10 Closure Criteria

### Required for Closure

1. ⏳ **Week-8.5 Gate PASSED** (Hard precondition)
   - Week-8.5 gate must pass before Week-10 can start
2. ⏳ **Week-9 CLOSED** (Hard precondition)

14. ⏳ **QCD/QCA Only Rule Enforced** (no duplicate calculators)
15. ⏳ **All Exports Read-Only** (no recalculation, no macros, no formulas)

### Current Closure Status

- **Structural Completion:** ⏳ PENDING (No scutwork plan mentioned yet)
- **Implementation Status:** ❌ NOT STARTED (Week-8.5 gate and Week-9 must pass first)
- **Precondition Status:** ⏳ PENDING (Week-8.5 gate and Week-9 must pass)
- **Compliance Alarms:** ❌ 3 alarms need resolution (ALARM-EXPORT-CORE, ALARM-EXPORT-PERMISSIONS, ALARM-EXPORT-AUDIT)
- **Formal Sign-off:** ⏳ PENDING

**Closure Rule:** Week-10 is CLOSED only if Week-8.5 gate passes and Week-9 closes, Excel exports are implemented (read-only, snapshot-only, QCD/QCA only), and export governance (permissions, audit logging) is complete. Week-10 does NOT change meaning - theme: "Expose, don't compute."

---

## Dependencies

### Requires (Execution)

- **Week-9:** Integration & Global Dashboard must be CLOSED (hard precondition - Week-10 cannot start without this)
- **Week-8.5:** Legacy Parity Gate must PASS (hard precondition - Week-10 cannot start without this)
- **Week-8:** Costing Pack Details must be complete (for costing pack export)
- **Week-7:** Costing Pack Foundation must be complete (for costing pack export)
- **Week-6:** D0 Gate must be passed (for costing pack foundation)

### Can Run in Parallel (Planning / Scaffolding)

- **Design:** Excel export structure design can proceed in parallel (but execution blocked until Week-8.5 gate passes and Week-9 closes)

### Blocks

- **Week-11:** Stabilization may depend on export functionality
- **Week-12:** Final closure depends on Week-10 completion

---

## Risks & Mitigations

### Risk 1: Excel Misused for Recalculation (Violates Read-Only Rule)

**Mitigation:** Lock sheets + no formulas. All exports must be read-only, snapshot-only. No recalculation, no macros, no formulas that recompute pricing. Locked sheets required.

### Risk 2: Data Leakage Through Exports

**Mitigation:** Permission matrix + deny-by-default. Export permissions must be enforced (role-based export access control, hard deny by default). Export permission matrix required.

### Risk 3: Audit Gaps Cause Compliance Issues

**Mitigation:** Mandatory export audit events required. Export audit logging must capture all exports (who/when/what exported). All exports must be auditable.

### Risk 4: Schema Changes Introduced

**Mitigation:** No schema changes allowed. Use existing schema only. Scope guard: no schema changes.

### Risk 5: Logic Duplication in Exports

**Mitigation:** QCD/QCA only rule enforced. All exports must use QCD/QCA only (no duplicate calculators). Exports are read-only snapshots of validated internal state.

### Risk 6: Scope Creep into Approval Workflows or Catalog Export

**Mitigation:** Explicit non-goals defined. Week-10 does not do: approval workflows, catalog data export (unless approved), client-side recompute. Scope guard: export only, no new logic.

### Risk 7: Week-10 Started Before Preconditions Met

**Mitigation:** Hard precondition check. Week-10 CANNOT START unless Week-8.5 Gate = PASS and Week-9 = CLOSED. If any precondition fails, return to originating week, not Week-10.

---

## Decision Point

**Week-10 Closure Status:**
- ⏳ **PENDING COMPLETION** (Preconditions must pass first)

**Options:**
1. **"Close Week-10 and start Week-11 detailed plan"** - If preconditions pass, Excel exports implemented, and export governance complete
2. **"Complete Week-10 implementation"** - If Excel exports or export governance still missing
3. **"Verify preconditions and proceed"** - If Week-8.5 gate or Week-9 needs verification

**Note:** Week-10 does NOT change meaning - theme: "Expose, don't compute." All exports are read-only, snapshot-based, QCD/QCA only. Week-10 CANNOT START unless Week-8.5 Gate = PASS and Week-9 = CLOSED.

**Document Status:** ✅ Complete - All alarms from matrix included  
**Last Verified:** 2025-01-27  
**Next Review:** After preconditions pass and implementation

**Note:** Week-10 does NOT change meaning - theme: "Expose, don't compute." All exports are read-only, snapshot-based, QCD/QCA only. Week-10 CANNOT START unless Week-8.5 Gate = PASS and Week-9 = CLOSED. Export scope is frozen: included (quotation summary, line items, costing snapshot, CostHead pivots, dashboard KPIs), excluded (live recalculation, editable Excel, approval workflows, catalog data export unless approved, client-side recompute).
