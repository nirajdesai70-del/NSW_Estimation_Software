# SoW — System of Work (TEMP / OPERATIONS)

## Purpose
This folder contains **temporary working files** — experiments, extractions, imports, and engineer scratch work.

---

## Core Principle

> **SoR = Data | SoE = Rules | SoW = Work | ARCH = History**

If a file is in **SoW**, it is **NOT truth** — it is temporary.

---

## Structure

```
SoW/
└── <CATEGORY>/
    ├── extraction_sessions/
    ├── ai_tests/
    ├── price_imports/
    └── SoW_<CATEGORY>_WORKING.xlsx
```

---

## Rules

✅ **Allowed:**
- Temporary extractions
- AI experiments
- Price import sessions
- Engineer scratch files
- Working drafts

❌ **Not Allowed:**
- Treating SoW files as authoritative
- Referencing SoW files in production
- Keeping SoW files indefinitely (archive or delete)

---

## File Naming Convention

**Pattern:**
```
SoW_<CATEGORY>_<PURPOSE>_<SESSION>.<ext>
```

**Examples:**
- `SoW_LC1E_EXTRACTION_WORKING.xlsx`
- `SoW_PRICE_IMPORT_SESSION_01.xlsx`
- `SoW_MPCB_AI_TEST_2026-01-03.xlsx`

---

## Lifecycle

1. **Create** in SoW for temporary work
2. **Use** for experiments and testing
3. **Archive** to `ARCH/` when done (if valuable)
4. **Delete** when no longer needed

---

## Usage

- ✅ Safe place for experiments
- ✅ No risk of corrupting SoR
- ✅ Can be deleted without impact
- ❌ Never reference in production code
- ❌ Never treat as authoritative

---

## Golden Rule

> **SoW experiments. SoR holds facts.**
