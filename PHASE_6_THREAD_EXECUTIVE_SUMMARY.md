## 🔍 NISH Legacy System Review

### Status: SEPARATE PROJECT

**Location:** `project/nish/README.md`

**Key Points:**
- **Separate from Phase 5** - Standalone analysis track
- **Read-only analysis** - No changes to code/database
- **Purpose:** Legacy data discovery, mapping, migration planning
- **Execution:** Requires separate approval, after Phase 5

**Connection to Phase 6:**
- **Track A-R: Reuse & Legacy Parity** needs NISH understanding
- Phase 6 needs legacy system knowledge for parity
- Migration tools may be needed for Phase 6

**Phase 6 Tasks Related to NISH:**
- [ ] Review NISH legacy documentation
- [ ] Understand legacy data structure
- [ ] Map legacy features to Track A-R
- [ ] Identify parity requirements
- [ ] Plan migration tools (if needed)
