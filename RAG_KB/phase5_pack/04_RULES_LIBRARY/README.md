# Rules Library

**Purpose:** Organized rules by domain, extracted from Phase 5 canonical sources.

**Structure:**
- `governance/` - Governance policies, charters, mode policies
- `catalog/` - Catalog interpretation rules, make/series policies
- `l1_l2/` - L1→L2 explosion logic and rules
- `make_series/` - Make and series policy rules
- `bundling/` - Bundling rules (built-in vs separate SKU)

**Population:** Files will be copied here by `kb_refresh` from Phase 5 canonical sources.
