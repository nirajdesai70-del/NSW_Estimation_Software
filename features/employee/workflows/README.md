# Employee/Role — Workflows

No dedicated workflow documentation found in Batch 10C.

Primary references:
- `../users/32_ADMIN_GUIDE.md` - User management operations (create, edit, reset password)
- `../_general/12_USER_MANAGEMENT.md` - User and role operations

To be added later (if workflow docs exist):
- User creation workflow
- Role assignment workflow
- Approval workflows (if role-based approvals exist)
- Password reset workflow
