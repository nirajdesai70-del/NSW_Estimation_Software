# Employee/Role — Roles

No dedicated roles documentation found in Batch 10C.

Primary references:
- `../_general/12_USER_MANAGEMENT.md` - Role table schema and permission structure
- `../../security/_general/36_SECURITY_GUIDE.md` - Security and access control

To be added later (if separate roles docs exist):
- Role definitions and hierarchy
- Role assignment workflows
- Role-based access control (RBAC) implementation
- Permission matrix per role
