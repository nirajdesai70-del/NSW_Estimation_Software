# Employee/Role — Permissions

No dedicated permissions documentation found in Batch 10C.

Primary references:
- `../_general/12_USER_MANAGEMENT.md` - Role-based permissions structure
- `../../security/_general/36_SECURITY_GUIDE.md` - Security and access control

To be added later (if separate permissions docs exist):
- Permission matrix per role
- Access control rules
- Module-level permissions
- Approval permissions
