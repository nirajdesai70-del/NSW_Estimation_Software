## 🎯 Direct Answers

### Q1: Are all file contents mapped in our new plan?

**Answer:** ⏳ **PENDING REVIEW**

**Status:**
- ✅ File locations mapped (42 files accounted for)
- ⏳ File contents NOT yet reviewed/mapped
- ⏳ Need to review each file to map contents

**Action Required:** Review all 19 files to be moved, map their contents to target locations.

---

### Q2: How to trace content?

**Answer:** Use the content traceability system:

1. **Content Inventory** - Extract all sections from each file
2. **Content Mapping** - Map each section to target location
3. **Reference Tracking** - Track all links and references
4. **Verification** - Verify nothing lost

**Documents Created:**
- `PHASE_5_CONTENT_TRACEABILITY.md` - Content mapping matrix
- `PHASE_5_FILE_CONTENT_REVIEW_CHECKLIST.md` - Review checklist
- `PHASE_5_CONTENT_SAFETY_PROTOCOL.md` - Safety measures
- `PHASE_5_HOW_TO_REVIEW_FILES.md` - Step-by-step guide

### Q3: Do we need to review each file individually?

**Answer:** **YES - But we have a systematic process**

**Why Review Individually:**
- Each file has unique content
- Each file has unique references
- Each file may need different handling
- Ensures nothing is lost

**How to Make It Efficient:**
- Use systematic review process (5 steps)
- Use templates and checklists
- Document findings as you go
- Can be done incrementally

**Time Estimate:**
- 20-40 minutes per file
- 6-13 hours total (can be spread over days)

3. Map content to targets
4. Track all references
5. Create master update plan

**Phase 2: Move (1 day)**

2. Update references
3. Verify after each move
