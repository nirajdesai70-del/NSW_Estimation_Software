# Exploration Mode Setup Summary

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2025-01-27  
**Status:** CANONICAL  
**Owner:** Phase 5 Senate  

## Purpose

This document summarizes the setup of Phase 5 Exploration Mode governance framework.

## Setup Date

**2025-01-27**

## Files Created

### 1. PHASE_5_MODE_POLICY.md
- Defines three modes: OPEN_GATE_EXPLORATION, STABILIZATION, FREEZE
- Establishes current mode as OPEN_GATE_EXPLORATION
- Defines mode transition rules and exit criteria
- Documents operating rules for each mode

### 2. FEATURE_DISCOVERY_LOG.md
- Tracks new ideas and features discovered during exploration
- Includes sample entries (FD-001 through FD-005)
- Defines entry format and status lifecycle
- Ensures "better working" options are captured without blocking progress

### 3. DECISION_CAPTURE_RULES.md
- Defines what qualifies as a decision
- Specifies required fields for decision entries
- Documents decision capture process
- Provides examples and templates

### 4. STABILIZATION_EXIT_CRITERIA.md
- Defines objective, measurable criteria for mode transitions
- Five criteria for Exploration → Stabilization:
  - A) Schema Churn Stability
  - B) Decision Closure
  - C) Fundamentals Compliance
  - D) Traceability Completeness
  - E) Implementation Readiness
- Includes readiness score calculation

### 5. STABILIZATION_CHECKPOINT_LOG.md
- Tracks weekly checkpoint evaluations
- Records readiness score progression
- Documents blockers and remediation plans
- Provides checkpoint template for future use

### 6. PENDING_INPUTS_REGISTER.md
- Tracks pending inputs from master documents
- Seven initial entries (PI-001 through PI-007)
- Ensures nothing is forgotten while maintaining exploration flexibility
- Defines integration policy

## Files Updated

### PHASE_5_DECISIONS_REGISTER.md
- Added D-008: Exploration Mode Policy decision
- Documents rationale for open-gate exploration approach

## Key Principles Established

1. **Open Gates with Controlled Capture:**
   - No hard entry gate checklist
   - Prerequisites are reference inputs, not blockers
   - All changes must be logged (Decision Register or Feature Discovery Log)

2. **Decision Capture Required:**
   - Any change to canonical outputs must be logged
   - Every decision must cite Fundamentals baseline
   - Divergences must be documented with rationale

3. **Natural Stabilization:**
   - Mode transitions happen when criteria are met naturally
   - No forced freezes before exploration completes
   - Weekly checkpoint process tracks readiness

4. **Fundamentals Alignment:**
   - Every decision must reference Fundamentals v2.0
   - Alignment status tracked (ALIGNED/DIVERGED/EXTENDED)
   - Traceability maintained even when diverging

## Current Status

**Mode:** 🔓 OPEN_GATE_EXPLORATION  
**Readiness Score:** 0% (exploration just started)  
**Next Checkpoint:** 2025-02-03 (weekly cadence)

## Next Steps

1. **Weekly Cadence:**
   - Monday: Change Summary
   - Wednesday: Readiness Check (update Stabilization Checkpoint Log)
   - Friday: Open Items Review

2. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Review pending decisions (D-005, D-006, D-007)
   - Review pending inputs (PI-001 through PI-007)
   - Begin adding alignment notes to schema sections
   - Calculate traceability coverage

3. **Ongoing:**
   - Capture all decisions as they are made
   - Log new feature discoveries
   - Update pending inputs register as items progress
   - Track schema churn (7-day window)

## Change Log

- **v1.0 (2025-01-27):** Initial exploration mode setup completed
