✅ A3.5 — Timestamp Naming Standard (Freeze-Gate Spec)

Phase: Phase-5
Category: A — Freeze Gate Verification
Item: A3.5
Status: ✅ COMPLETED (Freeze-ready)
Date: 2026-01-27
Purpose: Lock canonical naming rules for date/time fields so schema, APIs, and audits remain consistent and unambiguous.

⸻

1) Canonical Rule Set (Locked)

TS1 — Timestamp vs Date semantics (no mixing)
	•	Use *_at only for timestamp/datetime fields (with time).
	•	Use *_on only for date-only fields (no time).

✅ Examples:
	•	created_at, updated_at, overridden_at, modified_at (timestamps)
	•	effective_on (date-only) (use this naming if the column is DATE-only)

❌ Not allowed:
	•	effective_at if column is DATE-only
	•	created_on if column is TIMESTAMP

⸻

TS2 — Standard lifecycle timestamps (mandatory where applicable)
	•	Most tables MUST include:
	•	created_at
	•	updated_at

If a table is strictly append-only and never updated, updated_at may be omitted only if documented in Schema Canon.

⸻

TS3 — Actor + time pairs for actions

If you record an actor for an action, you MUST record the time using the same event name:

Pattern:
	•	<event>_by + <event>_at

✅ Examples already in Phase-5:
	•	overridden_by + overridden_at
	•	modified_by + modified_at
	•	created_by + created_at
	•	updated_by + updated_at

⸻

TS4 — Effective dating (pricing)

For effective-dated rows:
	•	Use:
	•	effective_from (DATE or TIMESTAMP — must match actual type)
	•	effective_to (same type as effective_from, nullable)

Rule:
	•	effective_from / effective_to are the only approved naming for validity windows.

⸻

TS5 — Soft delete timestamps

If soft delete is introduced later:
	•	Use:
	•	deleted_at (timestamp)
	•	deleted_by (actor)

Do not use is_deleted alone without a timestamp/actor pair.

⸻

TS6 — Audit/event timestamps

For append-only audit/event rows:
	•	Use created_at as the canonical event time.
	•	Avoid timestamp or time as generic column names.

⸻

TS7 — Timezone discipline
	•	Application code must treat stored timestamps consistently (one standard across the system).
	•	The Data Dictionary must not claim a timezone unless the implementation standard is explicitly defined.
	•	If you later standardize (e.g., UTC), document it once in Schema Canon and enforce across services.

⸻

2) Examples (Aligned to Current SPEC-5)

✅ Good:
	•	created_at, updated_at
	•	overridden_by, overridden_at
	•	modified_by, modified_at
	•	effective_from, effective_to

❌ Not allowed:
	•	createdOn, updatedOn (camelCase)
	•	effectiveDate (ambiguous)
	•	override_time (non-standard)
	•	date_created (non-standard ordering)

⸻

3) Enforcement Expectations
	•	All new migrations MUST follow TS1–TS7.
	•	Any deviation MUST include:
	•	justification in migration header, and
	•	a note in Schema Canon / Data Dictionary change log.

⸻

4) Freeze Gate Compliance
