## Changes Made

### Checklist Updates

Added A7 section to compliance matrix:
- A7.1 Runtime enforcement map
- A7.2 Deletion & mutation guardrails
- A7.3 Apply-Recalc safeguards
- A7.4 Audit coverage
- A7.5 Failure & recovery semantics
- A7.6 Checklist & Data Dictionary update

All items marked as ✅ VERIFIED with document references.

### Data Dictionary Updates

Added Rule 9: Runtime Enforcement & Governance to Business Rules section, establishing canonical reference to A7 governance documents and clarifying distinction between schema constraints and runtime behavior.

⸻

## Why This Matters

A7 ensures that runtime behavior (deletion rules, pricing application, audit coverage, and failure recovery) is explicitly governed and not left to implicit assumptions or schema inference. The Data Dictionary now clearly distinguishes schema guarantees vs runtime authority.

⸻

## Freeze Gate Status

- **A7:** ✅ VERIFIED
- **Category A impact:** No open runtime governance gaps
- **Schema changes:** None required

**Conclusion:**  
A7 is formally closed and approved for SPEC-5 freeze.

⸻

## Next Steps

A7 governance documentation is complete. All runtime enforcement, mutation controls, audit coverage, and failure recovery semantics are explicitly documented and aligned with A1–A6 decisions.
