# PHASE 3 CLOSURE & PHASE 4 HANDOVER — 5R BRIEF

Project: NSW Estimation Software  
Phase Closed: Phase 3 — Planning & Roadmap  
Status: 🔒 CLOSED (Gated & Approved)  
Execution Starts: Phase 4 (nish only)

---

## 1️⃣ RESULTS (What Phase 3 Delivered)

Phase 3 has fully converted knowledge into control.

Authoritative Outputs (Frozen)
	•	Execution Plan — purpose, scope, sequencing
	•	Target Architecture — logical, contract-first
	•	Refactor Sequence — S0 → S5 (primary), module order (secondary)
	•	Execution Rulebook (FINAL) — gates, approvals, rollback doctrine
	•	Task Governance
	•	TASK_REGISTER.md → index + standards only
	•	Batch files:
	•	B1 — S0/S1 Verification & Ownership
	•	B2 — S2 Isolation
	•	B3 — S3 Alignment
	•	B4 — S4 Propagation
	•	B5 — S5 Regression Gate
	•	Risk & Testing Gates — Bundles A / B / C fully defined

✅ Phase 3 now has zero ambiguity and zero execution leakage.

## 2️⃣ RISKS (What Is Now Explicitly Controlled)

Risk	Control Implemented
Meaning drift	Frozen baselines + S-stage sequencing
Hidden coupling	Boundary blocks + contracts
PROTECTED core damage	Wrapper-only doctrine + G4 gates
Partial rollout	“All-or-nothing” propagation rule
Unsafe release	Mandatory S5 regression gate
Rollback failure	“No rollback = no execution” rule

All HIGH / PROTECTED risks are now known, documented, and gated.

---

## 3️⃣ RULES (Non-Negotiable Going Forward)

These rules now govern all Phase-4 execution:
	1.	Execution happens only in nish
	2.	No Task ID → No Work
	3.	S-stage on task ID must match execution
	4.	PROTECTED logic = wrapper-only
	5.	Gate failure = immediate stop
	6.	Rollback must exist before execution
	7.	Batch-5 approval = only entry to Phase-4

Any deviation requires re-opening Phase 3 under governance.

---

## 4️⃣ ROADMAP (What Happens Next)

Phase 4 — Controlled Execution (nish)

Execution will follow exactly this order:
	1.	Pick approved tasks from:
	•	BATCH_1_S0_S1.md → verification evidence
	•	BATCH_2_S2.md → isolation
	•	BATCH_3_S3.md → alignment
	•	BATCH_4_S4.md → propagation
	2.	Execute one S-stage at a time
	3.	Apply gates (G1–G4) per Rulebook
	4.	Finish with S5 Regression Gate evidence
	5.	Release only after Go/No-Go sign-off

No parallel refactors. No shortcuts.

## Final Authority Statement

Phase 3 is closed.  
Planning is frozen.  
All future changes must be executed through approved Phase-4 tasks under the Execution Rulebook.

---

## What you should do next (one line)

When you’re ready to start real work, say:

“Proceed to Phase 4 — start execution with BATCH_1 tasks.”

I’ll then:
	•	switch posture from planning → execution support,
	•	help sequence the first execution sprint,
	•	and enforce gates exactly as defined.

You’ve built this correctly. Now it’s safe to execute.
