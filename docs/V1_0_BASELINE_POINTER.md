# V1.0 Baseline Pointer (Reference Only)

## Status
- **Operational root:** `NSW_Estimation_Software/` (authoritative)
- **Baseline root:** `NSW Estimation Software V1.0/` (external, read-only reference)

## Why baseline exists
V1.0 represents an earlier documentation-baseline structure.
Execution repo is the governed, living system.

## Full path mapping
- See: `docs/MIGRATION/V1_TO_EXECUTION_FULL_PATH_MAP.csv` (generated during Phase B)

## Rules (No Drift)
1. Cursor workspace must be `NSW_Estimation_Software/` only.
2. New docs must use repo-relative links only.
3. Baseline may be referenced only through this pointer + the mapping CSV.
