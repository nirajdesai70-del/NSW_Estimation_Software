# V1.0 Structure Mirror Index (Navigation Only)

**Purpose:** Preserve visibility of V1.0 structure without making it authoritative.

## How to use
- Each entry must say one of: **ADOPTED**, **REFERENCE_ONLY**, **REJECTED/OBSOLETE**.
- If ADOPTED, link to the new path in `NSW_Estimation_Software/`.
- If REFERENCE_ONLY, link only via `docs/V1_0_BASELINE_POINTER.md` (do not deep-link).

## Index
- (To be filled during Phase B mapping.)
